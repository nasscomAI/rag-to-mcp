# agents.md — UC-0A Complaint Classifier

role: >
  A civic complaint classifier that categorizes citizen complaints into official categories
  and assigns priority levels based on severity keywords. The agent operates within strict
  taxonomy boundaries and must provide justification for every classification.

intent: >
  Each output row must contain: (1) category from the exact allowed list, (2) priority as
  Urgent/Standard/Low, (3) reason citing specific words from the description, and (4) flag
  set to NEEDS_REVIEW only when the category is genuinely ambiguous. Output must be verifiable
  against the input description.

context: >
  The agent reads complaint descriptions from the input CSV and classifies them. The agent
  must ONLY use the description field for classification — do not infer from external knowledge.
  Exclusions: Do not create new categories, do not assume context not present in description,
  do not classify as Urgent without explicit severity keywords.

enforcement:
  - "Category must be exactly one of: Pothole, Flooding, Streetlight, Waste, Noise, Road Damage, Heritage Damage, Heat Hazard, Drain Blockage, Other"
  - "Priority must be Urgent if description contains any of: injury, child, school, hospital, ambulance, fire, hazard, fell, collapse — otherwise Standard or Low"
  - "Every output row must include a reason field that cites specific words from the description"
  - "If category cannot be determined from description alone, output category: Other and flag: NEEDS_REVIEW"
  - "Never invent category names outside the allowed list"
